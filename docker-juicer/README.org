* Docker Juicer

A way to tune Docker for everything it's got.

Primary use case:

AWS Lambda like power up / power down on demand, but with fast startup
times for slow start based images (Clojure).

** Start up (run) with minimal resources
You can boot up the container with limited memory, similar to:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker run --rm -it -m 128m clojure:alpine
#+END_SRC

** Saving on CPU
You can save CPU cycles if you don't mind pausing via:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker pause <container name>
#+END_SRC

** Saving on RAM
After you've paused it, you can force it into going into almost all
swap (to let other active runs use the ram) via:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker update --memory-swap=128m --memory=4m <container name>
#+END_SRC

(note: memory-swap is mem+swap, so for this trick, ensure swap is set
to at least as much as memory originally was)

To resume the thing:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker update --memory-swap=128m --memory=128m <container name>
#+END_SRC

** Checking on it

You can see if it did go into swap via:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/docker/*/memory.stat | grep -E '(swap|rss)'
#+END_SRC
